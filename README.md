# Godherja-the-Dying-World-1.0-mpjama
The 1.0 Release Version of Godherja the Dying World, a total conversion mod for CK3

To run this mod you have to have a copy of Crusader Kings 3, and place the Godherja folder in c:/Documents/ParadoxInteractive/CrusaderKings3/mod
then run Crusader Kings 3, and enable this mod in the launcher.

Too many files/too big of a zip file to upload to git, so here is a google drive link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gU7DTUuI7K4_PUvQLngKaK4mQZPbZ2RZ/view?usp=sharing

To play the most up to date version of Godherja use the steam workshop link here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2326030123
